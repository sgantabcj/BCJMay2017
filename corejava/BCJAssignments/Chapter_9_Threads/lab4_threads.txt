What will happen if you run the following program... 

public class TestClass extends Thread
{
   public void run()
   {
      for(;;);
   }

   public static void main(String args[])
   {
      System.out.println("Starting main");
      new TestClass().start();
      System.out.println("Main returns");
   }

}
 
Select 3 correct options 
a  It will print "Starting Main"   
b  It will print "Main returns"   
c  It will not print "Main returns"   
d  The program will never exit.   
e  main() method will never return   

Ans: d, because a thread is a separate path of execution and the following statements in the program
after invoking the start method will keep on executing simultaneously. So main returns will get printed
but thread will not die, so program never exits.
